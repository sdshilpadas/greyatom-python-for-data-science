### Project Overview

 The title of the project is Student management system. Through this project we can enter the name, courses and marks obtained in each course and get the student's name with the maximum marks in  certain subject or who scored the maximum marks in a particular course.  Here in this particular project we got  the student's name who secured the highest marks in mathematics .


### Learnings from the project

 On the completion of this project I got to know the various uses of list,dictionaries , various operations on lists and dictionaries and string indexing and formatting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 At first a list of the names of the students of a class  was created . Then a dictionary of courses with the values were created of a particular student . Next another dictionary was created of marks of a certain course of all the students and the student who got the maximum marks in that particular course was printed and given a certificate.


### Challenges faced

 I got a few syntax error which I evaluated and corrected according to the error message which was shown.


### Additional pointers

 The project was altogether very informative. I gained a lot of knowledge and experience throughout this project.
